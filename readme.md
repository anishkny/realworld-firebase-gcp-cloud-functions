> ### Firebase + GCP Cloud Functions codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

### [Demo]()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Firebase + GCP Cloud Functions** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Firebase + GCP Cloud Functions** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


# How it works

This repo provides an implementation for the backend as defined by the [RealWorld API Spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api#readme).

Authentication and Database are handled by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/). The API is handled by a thin layer made up of [Google Cloud Platform Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/).

# Getting started

1. Setup a new Firebase project
2. Setup a new GCP Project, and enable Cloud Functions
3. ...TODO...
